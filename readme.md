## Use
Data downloading currently in src/room_rate/data/data_downloader.ipynb  #TODO change to module
Data manipulation in data/data_manipulation.ipybn #TODO change to module
Training and testing in notebooks/train.ipynb

Tests in test/ can be run with pytest

### Aditional TODO
- Experiments
    - Treat as classification (e.g. cross-entropy loss) instead of regression
    - Other architectures
- Set up convenient inference flow
